Title: Pelican Python3 Makefile error

Full error:

```sh
$ cd /home/<user>/path_to_project_root/output && python3 -m pelican.server
$ /usr/bin/python3: Error while finding spec for 'pelican.server' (ImportError: No module named 'pelican')
$ Makefile:77: recipe for target 'serve' failed
$ make: *** [serve] Error 1
```

Description:

This error appears when trying to run **make serve** from the terminal in a virtualenv environment where python3 is not installed and Makefile is configured for use with python3.

I would assume installing a version of python3 in virtual environment may solve this but I havenâ€™t tested this.
I fixed this by changing line 1 in Makefile from **PY?=python3** to **PY?=python**.
