#About This Site

My intention for this site is to encapsulate my thoughts, projects, and any technical processes that may be difficult to remember. If anyone else benefits from the content in this site, then that’s great!

This site is built on <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/" target="_blank">Pelican</a>, a static site generator written in Python. Pelican supports Jinja, a templating engine written in Python which allows the user to modularize their content and build logic into their web pages.

The content in this site is written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, a lightweight markup language which can be converted to valid HTML. In my opinion Markdown is much easier to read and much faster to work with than a tag based language like HTML.

The theme used in this site is my personal modification of <a href="https://github.com/Parbhat/pelican-blue" target="_blank">Pelican-Blue</a>, a responsive Pelican theme created by <a href="https://parbhatpuri.com/" target="_blank">Parbhat Puri</a>. The modification is a working progress and will be updated throughout the life of this project, or until I decide to change theme ;) . 

So far this site has been a wonderful learning experience, using a vast combination of technologies. It’s helping me polish my web development skills and pushing me to explore concepts that I’ve never used before. Most importantly it has been very rewarding and great fun!
