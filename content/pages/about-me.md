# About Me

Hey internet, my name is Jason and I'm an IT student in my senior year. I enjoy tinkering with technology. I am currently learning about static site generators, python, flask, soldering, raspberry pi, and many other technologies. I am naturally a curious person and often find myself asking questions about topics that I don't understand, regardless of whether or not they have anything to do with technology.

My intent for this blog is to serve as my personal journal to record my progress as well as any processes or methods that I feel I may have a hard time remembering. I may also jot down the occasional random topic, like good places to eat ;) . 

If this blog has any content that you enjoy reading or that you find helpful then that makes me happy. I believe that technology and especially software is very empowering and can lead to solutions to many of today's real world problems. Let's learn together, share knowledge, and change the world one line of code at a time :) .
